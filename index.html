                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p><B>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</B> (Hindustani pronunciation: 25 December 1924 â€“ 16
                    August 2018) was an Indian politician and statesman who served three terms as the 10th Prime
                    Minister of India, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to
                    1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004. Vajpayee was one of the co-founders and a senior
                    leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He was a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a
                    Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He was the first Indian prime minister not of the Indian
                    National Congress to serve a full term in office. He was also a renowned poet and a writer.

                    He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, having been elected ten times to the
                    Lok Sabha, the lower house, and twice to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. He served as the Member
                    of Parliament for Lucknow, retiring from active politics in 2009 due to health concerns. He was
                    among the founding members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), of which he was president from 1968 to
                    1972. The BJS merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party, which won the 1977 general
                    election. In March 1977, Vajpayee became the Minister of External Affairs in the cabinet of Prime
                    Minister Morarji Desai. He resigned in 1979, and the Janata alliance collapsed soon after. Former
                    members of the BJS formed the BJP in 1980, with Vajpayee its first president.</p>
